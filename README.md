# JavaPiano

NOTE: This program was forked from https://github.com/kilbyjmichael/JavaPiano and modified to comply with school assignment requirements.

A soundboard like program that plays Piano notes. JavaPiano creates 88 keys with an actionListener that produces a piano midi note when pressed.

Modification:
The note's letter name, note's key type or color, note's frequency and the note's length are given to the user as he/she presses a key on the piano keyboard.
